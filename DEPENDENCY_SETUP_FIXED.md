# Dependency Setup Issues - RESOLVED ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. psycopg2-binary Installation Issue
**Problem**: The original `psycopg2-binary==2.9.9` was trying to build from source on Windows, failing due to missing PostgreSQL development libraries.

**Solution**: 
- Updated requirements.txt to use `psycopg2-binary>=2.9.5` for more flexibility
- The system automatically installed `psycopg2-binary==2.9.10` which has pre-built Windows wheels
- Enhanced setup script with fallback installation strategies

### 2. NumPy/SciPy/Pandas Build Issues
**Problem**: Packages were trying to build from source, requiring C compilers (MSVC) that weren't available.

**Solution**:
- Used `--only-binary=all` flag to force installation of pre-built wheels
- Updated to compatible versions:
  - numpy: 2.3.2 (latest with Windows wheels)
  - pandas: 2.3.2 (compatible with numpy 2.x)
  - scipy: 1.16.1 (latest compatible version)

### 3. Streamlit Compatibility
**Problem**: Original streamlit==1.28.1 required numpy<2, but we needed numpy 2.x for other packages.

**Solution**:
- Upgraded to streamlit>=1.48.0 which supports numpy 2.x
- All dependencies now work together harmoniously

### 4. tiktoken Rust Compiler Issue
**Problem**: tiktoken==0.5.1 required Rust compiler to build from source.

**Solution**:
- Upgraded to tiktoken>=0.11.0 which has pre-built Windows wheels
- No more Rust compiler dependency

### 5. Enhanced Setup Script
**Improvements**:
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Automatic detection of Docker/Docker Compose variants
- Fallback installation strategies for problematic packages
- Clear instructions for manual steps when needed
- Validation of required files (requirements.txt, docker-compose.yml)

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Dependencies
All Python dependencies are now successfully installed:
- FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, Alembic
- PostgreSQL driver (psycopg2-binary)
- Redis, Celery for background tasks
- Streamlit, Plotly, Pandas for frontend
- NumPy, SciPy for analysis
- tiktoken for text processing
- pytest, httpx for testing

### ⚠️ Docker Required
The only remaining requirement is Docker Desktop for PostgreSQL and Redis services.

## Next Steps

### 1. Install Docker Desktop (if not already installed)
Download from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

### 2. Run the Setup Script
```bash
python scripts/setup.py
```

### 3. Start the Services
After Docker is installed and the setup script completes:

```bash
# Start backend API
uvicorn app.api.main:app --reload

# Start Celery worker (new terminal)
celery -A app.workers.analysis_worker worker --loglevel=info

# Start frontend (new terminal)
streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py
```

Or use the individual start scripts:
```bash
python scripts/start_backend.py
python scripts/start_worker.py
python scripts/start_frontend.py
```

### 4. Access the Application
- Frontend: http://localhost:8501
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Updated Requirements.txt
The requirements.txt has been updated with working versions:

```txt
# Backend dependencies
fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
sqlalchemy==1.4.48
psycopg2-binary>=2.9.5
alembic==1.12.1
redis==5.0.1
celery==5.3.4
pydantic==1.10.13
python-multipart==0.0.6

# Frontend dependencies
streamlit>=1.48.0
plotly==5.17.0
pandas>=2.0.0
requests==2.31.0

# Analysis dependencies
numpy>=1.24.0
scipy>=1.10.0
tiktoken>=0.11.0

# Development dependencies
pytest==7.4.3
pytest-asyncio==0.21.1
httpx==0.25.2
python-dotenv==1.0.0
```

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Use version ranges** instead of exact versions for better compatibility
2. **Prefer pre-built wheels** over source builds on Windows
3. **Test dependency compatibility** before pinning versions
4. **Provide fallback strategies** in setup scripts
5. **Clear error messages** help users resolve issues independently

The dependency setup is now robust and should work reliably on Windows systems with Python 3.13.
