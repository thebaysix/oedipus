# Oedipus Production Roadmap
*"Observability & Analytics Infrastructure for AI Systems"*

## Strategic Positioning
**What Oedipus IS**: 
- Observability layer for AI model/agent completions (like DataDog for infrastructure)
- Analytics and visualization platform for AI system behavior
- Standardized schema and API for AI evaluation data
- Developer productivity tools for AI iteration cycles

**What Oedipus is NOT**:
- An evaluation algorithm or scoring system
- A provider of "ground truth" judgments
- A replacement for domain-specific evaluation logic

**Core Value**: You bring the data (prompts, completions, and optionally your own evaluations), Oedipus provides the infrastructure to collect, analyze, visualize, and monitor it at scale.

## Data Philosophy: "Bring Your Own Evaluation"
- **Oedipus provides**: Information-theoretic metrics (entropy, token counts, consistency)
- **You provide**: Domain evaluations, human judgments, business metrics, custom scores
- **Result**: Comprehensive view combining objective measurements with your domain expertise

## Usage Patterns Supported
- **In-flight**: Real-time evaluation via API calls during development/production
- **Post-hoc**: Batch analysis of collected evaluation data
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated regression detection and performance monitoring
- **Live Monitoring**: Production model/agent observability and alerting

## Phase 1: Developer MVP (In-flight + Post-hoc)
**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**
**Goal: Solve the "custom evaluation script" problem for individual developers**

### Core Developer Features
- **Universal Data Ingestion**
  ```python
  # You bring your own evaluation logic
  response = model.generate(prompt)
  your_score = your_custom_evaluator(prompt, response)  # Your domain logic
  
  # Oedipus provides observability infrastructure
  elmstash.log({
      'input': prompt,
      'output': response,
      'model': 'gpt-4o-mini',
      'custom_scores': {
          'accuracy': your_score,
          'domain_quality': your_human_rating,
          'business_metric': conversion_rate
      },
      'metadata': {'version': 'v1.2', 'user_segment': 'enterprise'}
  })
  ```

- **Analytics & Visualization Layer**
  - Information-theoretic metrics (entropy, consistency, patterns)
  - Custom score aggregation and trending
  - Correlation analysis between different evaluation dimensions
  - Performance monitoring and alerting on YOUR metrics

- **Developer Productivity Tools**
  - Session-based organization and versioning
  - A/B testing infrastructure for model comparisons
  - Automated reporting and dashboard generation
  - Export capabilities for further analysis

### Technical Infrastructure

          'safety': assess_medical_safety(output), 
          'empathy': rate_empathy(output)
      }
  
  # Oedipus handles the infrastructure
  for case in medical_test_cases:
      response = model.generate(case.input)
      scores = evaluate_medical_response(case.input, response)
      elmstash.log(input=case.input, output=response, scores=scores)
